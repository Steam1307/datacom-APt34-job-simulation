# Task 1: APT Breach: Analysing the Impact on Information Security
## Background
Welcome to the fascinating world of cybersecurity! In this task, you will be stepping into the role of a cybersecurity consultant here at Datacom. One of our leading tech corporation clients has fallen prey to a sophisticated cyberattack by a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as APT34. The attack, believed to be sponsored by a foreign government, has left the organisation's network compromised, and valuable customer data and intellectual property has been stolen.

Your mission is to conduct initial research on this APT group, APT34, and assess the extent of the breach's impact on the organisation's information security. But fear not, for you will be provided with all the necessary tools required to understand cybersecurity concepts and principles, including cyberthreats, attack methods, and the importance of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. In addition, you will also be familiarised with APT34's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and the common vulnerabilities they exploit to gain access to networks.

The objective of this task is to help our client conduct an initial investigation into APT34 and evaluate the potential impact of the attack on the organization. As a result, you will need to produce a comprehensive report documenting your findings and outlining key recommendations for improving the organisation's cybersecurity posture.

As you delve deeper into the world of cybersecurity, you will come to appreciate the critical role it plays in protecting organisations against cyberthreats. With the ever-increasing reliance on technology and the internet, cybersecurity has become a vital aspect of any organisation's operations. It is no longer a question of whether an organisation will be targeted but rather a question of when. This task provides you with an excellent opportunity to learn and gain practical experience in the cybersecurity field while making a positive impact on our client's security posture.
## Task
As a cybersecurity professional, you will be expected to utilise various Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools and techniques to gather information on APT34. You can find some OSINT tools in the resources section; however, feel free to conduct your own individual research.

You will also need to apply the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, a standardised tool used to identify and categorise cyberthreats, to develop a comprehensive defence strategy to protect the client's networks and systems against future attacks. You should answer the following questions in your research:

1. What is their history?

2. Which nation/state are they associated with?

3. Do they target specific industries?

4. What are their motives?

5. What are the TTPs they use to conduct their attacks?

6. What security measures could the client implement to defend against cyberattacks conducted by this APT?

Your ultimate goal is to communicate your findings and recommendations effectively to the client's leadership team, providing actionable insights that can improve the corporation's security posture. Submit your findings in the text submission box below.

Are you ready to take on this challenge and become a cybersecurity hero?

Let's get started!
# APT34 Report
## History
They are an Advanced persistent group that's been active since 2014. They work on behalf of the Iranian government and their targets are mostly victims in the middle east region. They are mainly focused on stealth and persistence rather than destruction and ransomware. They got more exposure in 2019 because a group called “Lab Dookhtegan” leaked several of APT34’s tools and internal information, bringing more public attention to the group’s methods and capabilities.##
## Nation Association
It is believed that they work on behalf of the Iranian government specifically linked to the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and  to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which is a military organization
## Targeted industries
They attack certain industries including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications and it is mainly in the middle east and the united states and the main objective is to collect sensitive information to benefit the Iranian government
## Motives
They are largely focused on reconnaissance efforts that would largely benefit Iranian nation state interests, they do this by stealing information from governments or private companies for their own benefit
## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
APT34 employs a range of TTPs to carry out their attacks. They commonly use spear-phishing and social engineering to gain initial access, along with delivering malware via malicious websites and password spraying techniques. The group is known for using custom malware, such as the POWRUNER backdoor, to infiltrate target systems. To maintain persistence and avoid detection, APT34 frequently relies on custom-built malware, command-and-control (C2) servers, and legitimate tools and software, allowing them to blend in and evade security defenses effectively.
## Security Measures for Defense
- Threat Intelligence & MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: i would suggest to use MITRE ATT&CK to map observed behavior and detect known TTPs of APT34.
- Email security: Deploy advanced email filtering to detect and block phishing attempts and train employees to recognize suspicious emails
- User awareness: Conduct security awareness training to reduce the success of social engineering attacks.
- Regular Audits and Incident Response: i suggest to perform regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing and develop and test an incident response plan
- Application and web server security: Regularly patch and update servers and use web application firewalls to block exploitation attempts
# Task 2: Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
## Background 
Congratulations on successfully completing the first task!

Your initial research on the APT group is a crucial step because it helps to identify the potential attackers and their methods, motives and targets. Understanding the TTPs of APT34 helps identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could be exploited. 

This has laid a solid foundation for the next task, which is to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the client. The client has a fence around the perimeter of its property and a padlock on its entrance gate to prevent unauthorised access. However, the leadership team is concerned about potential risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of its information and systems. They require a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in their system or network.

As a cybersecurity consultant, you understand that conducting a risk assessment is an essential component of any effective cybersecurity strategy. This involves identifying, evaluating and prioritising potential security threats and vulnerabilities to determine the level of risk and develop a plan to mitigate those risks. During the risk assessment, you will need to identify the assets that need to be protected, define the risk matrix and identify potential risk scenarios. You will assess the risk ratings for each scenario, both with and without existing measures in place. Finally, you will provide a risk assessment report to the client summarising your findings and recommendations for mitigating risks and improving the institution's security posture.

The goal of the risk assessment is to help the client prioritise and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate and minimise risks. This will ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information and systems, as well as protect their reputation and financial resources. Ultimately, your work will help the client comply with regulatory and legal requirements and standards and provide peace of mind knowing that their security is being handled by a knowledgeable and experienced cybersecurity expert.
## Task 
In this task, you will be documenting the client's risk position using the padlock analogy as an example. The client wants you to help them define the context, assess their risk matrix and identify potential risk scenarios.

To complete this task, you will need to:

1. Define the context – Identify the assets that need to be protected. This could include sensitive information, customer data, financial information or any other critical assets that are important to the client.

2.Define the risk matrix – Define the likelihood, consequence and risk rating for each potential risk scenario. The likelihood is the probability of the risk scenario occurring, while the consequence is the severity of the potential impact. The risk rating is a measure of the overall risk posed by the scenario, calculated by multiplying the likelihood and consequence.
3. Define three risk scenarios – Identify the specific risks that the client is trying to protect their assets from. For example, a cyberattack, natural disaster or employee negligence.

4. Assess risk rating for each risk scenario – Calculate the inherent risk rating for each scenario, assuming there are no measures in place to reduce the risk (without fence and padlock in place).

5. Assess risk rating for each risk scenario with existing measures – Calculate the current risk rating for each scenario taking existing measures in place to reduce the risk into consideration (with fence and padlock in place).

6. Assess risk levels for each risk scenario with additional measures – Identify any additional measures that could be put in place to further reduce the risk. Calculate the target risk rating for each scenario with these additional measures in place.

7. Create a risk assessment report for the client that summarises the risk assessment findings, the risk mitigation strategy and any recommended measures for implementation.
